## About 👩🏻‍💻 👩‍💻

A chatbot programmed to operate as a youth mental health first aider with a focus on despression and anxiety. Built using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js) and Dialogflow (natural language understanding). This is the final project built with [Emily Cotter](https://github.com/EmilyRoseCotter) as part of [Manchester Codes](https://www.manchestercodes.com) software engineering bootcamp.

The frontend for this app can be found [here](https://github.com/EmilyRoseCotter/chatable-front-end).

## Why Chatable? 🌿

Mental health illness can be hard to talk about sometimes. Chatable provides a safe space for young people to talk and seek for professional supports. As an online youtn mental health first aider, Chatable fills the gap between professional support and young people, and to encourage young people to seek for professional medical help.
